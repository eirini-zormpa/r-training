# About
This repository contains materials used to teach R to employees of the RSA.
They were used in a hands-on live-coding workshop.

The links to the slides will be added below:

- Slides for Session 1: [Introduction to R](https://thersaorg.github.io/r-training/slides/1_intro-to-R.html#/title-slide)
- Slides for Session 2: Getting started with data in R
- Slides for Session 3: Data wrangling with `tidyr` and `dplyr`
- Slides for Session 4: Data visualisation with `ggplot2`
- Slides for Session 5: Literate programming with Quarto

The scripts created during the session can be found in the `demos` folder.

These materials were based on the [Data Carpentry R for Social Scientists lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/index.html).
